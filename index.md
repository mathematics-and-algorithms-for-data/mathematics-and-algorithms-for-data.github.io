# Visual Computing and Machine Learning

Welcome to my website.
I am a [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org) Industry Fellow and work in the
[Department of Computer Science](http://www.bath.ac.uk/comp-sci/) at the
[University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk/) as a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor)
in Computer Vision, Graphics and Machine Learning.

I also hold an Honorary Lecturer position in the Virtual Environments and Computer Graphics Group in the
[Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) at
[University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/)
where I was formerly a Research Associate working with
[Jan Kautz](http://jankautz.com) and
[Simon Prince](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fjm67xYAAAAJ&hl=en) 
on synthesizing and editing photorealistic
visual objects funded by the [EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/).

My main area of research involves learning models of shape (2D and 3D) and appearance from images.
In particular, I am interested in performing this in an automatic or interactive fashion that
allows these technologies to be put to use in a variety of applications without requiring
users to have computer vision or graphics expertise. 

I am also interested in machine learning problems where data is scarce or expensive to obtain (e.g. annotations from expert clinicians) and when uncertainty in the resulting output is important (e.g. medical applications). This has led to work on unsupervised (or semi-supervised) learning with Bayesian non-parametric models, in particular Gaussian processes.
