The centre for Mathematics and Algorithms for Data (MAD) at the [University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk/) is an interdisciplinary group of researchers working at the intersection of Statistics, Machine Learning and Numerical Analysis with a huge range of application areas. Data Scientists use mathematics and computation to extract useful information from data. MAD aims to facilitate dialogue between groups, especially theorists in computer science and mathematics, and develop rigour in the field.

Welcome to my website.
I am a [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org) Industry Fellow and work in the
[Department of Computer Science](http://www.bath.ac.uk/comp-sci/) at the
[University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk/) as a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor)
in Computer Vision, Graphics and Machine Learning.

I also hold an Honorary Associate Professor position in the Vision, Virtual Environments and Computer Graphics Group in the
[Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) at
[University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/)
where I was formerly a Research Associate working with
[Jan Kautz](http://jankautz.com) and
[Simon Prince](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fjm67xYAAAAJ&hl=en) 
on synthesizing and editing photorealistic
visual objects funded by the [EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/).

My main area of research involves learning models of shape (2D and 3D) and appearance from images.
In particular, I am interested in performing this in an automatic or interactive fashion that
allows these technologies to be put to use in a variety of applications without requiring
users to have computer vision or graphics expertise. 

I am also interested in machine learning problems where data is scarce or expensive to obtain (e.g. annotations from expert clinicians) and when uncertainty in the resulting output is important (e.g. medical applications). This has led to work on unsupervised (or semi-supervised) learning with Bayesian non-parametric models, in particular Gaussian processes.
