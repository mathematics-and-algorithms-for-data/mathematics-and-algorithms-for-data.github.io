# Our mission

To exploit machine-learning methodologies for the effective treatment of rheumatic diseases.

Assessment of joint damage via X-rays is an essential part of treating and diagnosing various types of arthritis. This task is traditionally undertaken by rheumatologists, which is both time consuming and expensive. Improving the assessment of X-rays has huge potential for advancing precision medicine in arthritis treatment including the potential of improving diagnosis and prognosis, understanding which treatments can help prevent damage to joints and improving trial design for novel therapeutic agents.
