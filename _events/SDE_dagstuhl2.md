<h1 style="text-align: center;" class="pb-2">MAD Workshop "SDEs and ML - What should we use where? (day two)"</h1>



Our inspiration is the science-forward “Dagstuhl-style” meetings and our intention is to encourage a free and frank discussion and to that end we are intentionally keeping the meeting small and will not be recording or distributing the talks and discussions. We hope that the workshop will result in new ideas and collaborations will emerge as a result. All participants will be given a 25 min time slot for a free form short talk and we include time for questions and discussions - whilst the workshop will formally close at 17:00 BST on each day, the online forum will stay open and we encourage discussions to continue for as long as everyone is able!

Organisers: Neill Campbell, Matthias Ehrhardt, Tony Shardlow.
