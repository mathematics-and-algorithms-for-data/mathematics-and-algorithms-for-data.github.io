#### Talk: Modelling and matching deformable structures in images

Many objects of interest in images can be represented as deformed versions of some average structure - for instance faces, bones and many organs in medical images. The shape of an object can be represented as the positions of a set of landmark points. By analysing how the positions of the points vary from one example to another, we can learn the mean shape and the ways in which the shape can vary.

This talk will describe methods of constructing statistical models of the variation in shape and appearance of a variety objects from annotated sets of examples.  The parameters of such models give a compact description of examples of a class, and can be used to identify individuals or to learn how appearance changes between groups.

Since accurately annotating landmarks on new images is difficult and time-consuming, automatic methods of locating such points using the models have been developed.  Particularly effective are regression-based techniques which predict the update to model parameters or landmark point positions from image features.

We will describe a powerful recent approaches using both Random Forest regression and Convolutional Neural Networks to vote for the most likely position of each model point, leading to robust and accurate model fitting.

#### Biography

Tim Cootes has a BSc in Mathematics and Physics from Exeter University (1986), and PhD in Engineering from Sheffield City Polytechnic (1991).

He began work in Computer Vision at the Department of Medical Biophysics, Manchester University in 1991. He has remained in the same group ever since, though its name has changed several times.  He was awarded an EPSRC Advanced Fellowship in 1995, and became a Lecturer in 2002.

In 2006 he became a Professor of Computer Vision within the Imaging Sciences group.

His work focuses on developing models of the appearance of objects in digital images, using statistical models to represent variation in both shape and the appearance.  These have been applied to a wide variety of problems including facial image interpretation and medical image analysis.  His work has been widely adopted - his paper on "Active Shape Models" has been cited over 8000 times.

In 2010 Prof Cootes was elected as a Fellow of the International Associate for Pattern Recognition.

In 2014 he was awarded the title of Distinguished Fellow of the British Machine Vision Association.
