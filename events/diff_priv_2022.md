# MAD Workshop "Statistical Learning and Differential Privacy 2022

Statistical learning (or machine learning) and deep learning techniques have been deployed widely in almost all parts of our lives nowadays, for example in search engines, online recommendation systems, AI-assisted healthcare and on edge devices like mobile phones. An important and urgent question to address is how we can perform statistical learning to learn general patterns from datasets that are useful without revealing data of individual participants? This question has become the key challenge that hinders further applications of statistical learning and deep learning in privacy-sensitive applications. Differential privacy is a mathematical framework that can provide theoretical guarantees to this question, while allowing us to achieve model utility and accuracy for specific problems in applications. Statistical learning that preserves differential privacy has been an intense field of study in recent years. Top conferences in machine learning such as NeurIPS and ICML have dedicated workshops on this topic every year. 

Mathematics has been the key for breakthroughs in developing statistical learning with DP. Recently, we are excited to see novel works that apply compressive learning and dynamical systems in designing and proving statistical learning algorithms with DP guarantees and studying uncertainty quantifications of such algorithms. The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from statistical machine learning, deep learning, compressive sensing, dynamical systems and Bayesian neural networks to discuss this recent development and provide a snapshot of this interdisciplinary research topic to students, mathematicians, computer scientists and the wider community. 

This workshop is organised by the [Center for Mathematics and Algorithms for Data (MAD)](https://mathematics-and-algorithms-for-data.github.io/) at the [University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk). It is sponsored by [ART-AI](https://cdt-art-ai.ac.uk/) and [Maths4DL](https://people.bath.ac.uk/mascjb/maths4dl.html).
