<h1 style="text-align: center;" class="pb-2">MAD Workshop "Estimating functions from data"</h1>

After a long break, the [Center for Mathematics and Algorithms for Data (MAD)]({{ site.baseurl }}/) at the [University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk) is organising the second workshop day. On 7th May we are (virtually) welcoming 6 speakers who will present on different methods and applications of data-driven function estimation in machine learning.


The event is supported by the Departments of [Mathematical Sciences](https://www.bath.ac.uk/departments/department-of-mathematical-sciences/) and [Computer Science](https://www.bath.ac.uk/departments/department-of-computer-science/).
<!-- and by the [Institute for Mathematical Innovation](https://www.bath.ac.uk/research-institutes/institute-for-mathematical-innovation/) -->

<h4 class="pt-2">Venue: Online via Zoom</h4>
<h4>Date: Friday 7<sup>th</sup> May 2021</h4>

The Zoom link will be emailed around later.
Attendance is free, but please **do sign up on [a Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPCGpVcfcpfB4lAEIstcwqbtIT4QOYqBm0Ggn7of4GMsOXag/viewform?usp=sf_link)** if you are tuning in.
This would allow us to estimate the numbers for gather.town breaks, and to communicate the links in emails only to keep out possible Zoom bombers.
